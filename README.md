# musicalprompt

brute force short prompts which find loopy generations


searchprompt.py -> find short prompts which cause loopy gens (can pass model name i think too)

testprompt.py -> test for gpt2 .. modify this script for other llms if you want

Note; tested for gpt2 currently.. need to also add verification step probably to make it validate the loops.. somehow for gpt2 it gave in one shot
